# Solana Native Program: Account Initialization, Deposit, and Withdrawal

This project is part of my assessment in the Solana Fellowship Program, it implements a native Solana program that allows you to initialize an account, deposit SOL into it, and withdraw 10% of the deposited SOL at a given time. The program uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to securely manage accounts.


## Features

- **Account Initialization**: Create a new account using a Program Derived Address (PDA).
- **Deposit SOL**: Deposit SOL into the initialized account.
- **Withdraw SOL**: Withdraw 10% of the deposited SOL at a given time from the account.
